# Neuromorphic Inference Lab

I build **production-grade ML systems** end-to-end: **data → features → training → artefacts → serving → evaluation → monitoring**.  
Focus: **MLOps**, **LLMOps (RAG)**, and **reproducible forecasting**

## Hero systems
### MV Grid Fault Risk Scoring Platform
Fault risk inference for medium-voltage networks with tracked training, artefact versioning, and API serving.

Code: https://github.com/nepryoon/mv-grid-fault-risk

### RAG Copilot (LLMOps)
RAG with retrieval traceability, citations, guardrails, and an evaluation harness for regression testing.  
Docs: https://www.neuromorphicinference.com/demos/rag-copilot/  
Code: https://github.com/nepryoon/nil-rag-copilot

### Forecast Studio
Forecasting system with validation, backtesting, reproducibility, and memo-style artefacts for stakeholders.
