# Neuromorphic Inference Lab (Dublin)

I build **production-grade ML systems** end-to-end: **data → features → training → artefacts → serving → evaluation → monitoring**.  
Focus: **MLOps**, **LLMOps (RAG)**, and **reproducible forecasting**. Based in **Dublin**.

## Hero projects
### MV Grid Fault Risk Scoring Platform
End-to-end risk inference for medium-voltage networks: feature engineering, tracked training, artefact versioning, API serving, and demo UI.

### RAG Knowledge Copilot (LLMOps)
Grounded drafting with retrieval traceability, citations, guardrails, and an evaluation harness for regression testing.  
Docs: https://www.neuromorphicinference.com/demos/rag-copilot/

### Forecast Studio
Forecasting system built to escape the notebook trap: validation, backtesting, reproducibility, and artefacts suitable for stakeholders.
